## Creative Tax Repo
A Go-Based Service that generates IP-Box/Creative Tax compliant entries, using Oauth and Google Gemini. 
Why? Because I was tired of manually doing this every month.

1. Uses Oauth to grab information from JIRA Cloud using the REST (Ver 2) API
2. Grabs issues worked on by the user via Oauth
  - User has the option to use an API token - in cases that the oauth connection doesn't work

### Requirements
* A JIRA Developer Application to be set up 
* These Oauth scopes:
  - `"offline_access", "read:me", "read:project.avatar:jira", "read:filter:jira", "read:group:jira", "read:issue:jira", "read:attachment:jira", "read:comment:jira", "read:comment.property:jira", "read:field:jira", "read:issue-details:jira", "read:field.default-value:jira", "read:field.option:jira", "read:field:jira", "read:group:jira"`
    (Note: `offline_access` is required for the `refresh_token` flow to be triggered)


## Dev Mode
(TODO section later)s

### All Environment Variables Needed
These environment variables can be set as command line args or on a OS-level

```
SERVICE_NAME=lowercased-name-of-service

# Jira App Details
CLIENT_SECRET=<taken-from-developer-app>
CLIENT_ID=<taken-from-developer-app>
OAUTH_URL=https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token
REDIRECT_URL=<<taken-from-developer-app> 

# Server Details
PORT=<port to launch server on>
HOST=<hostname to use>
DEV_MODE=<boolean>

## Cors
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<origin-string>,<origin2-string>
ALLOWED_HEADERS=<header-string1>,<header-string2>

## LLM 
LLM_API_KEY=<developer-api-key>
```

### Approach
* Each service must be:
  i. Scale-able/non-blocking when operating
  ii. Fault-tolerant
  iii. Error hardened
